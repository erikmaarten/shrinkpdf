Alfred Klomp's script for resizing pdfs (source: http://www.alfredklomp.com/programming/shrinkpdf/).

Usage excerpt from the site:

You can also provide a second filename for the output:
```
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
```

And an output resolution in DPI (default is 72 DPI):
```
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf 90
```

Also enable color to grayscale conversion:
```
./shrinkpdf.sh -g in.pdf out.pdf 90
```
